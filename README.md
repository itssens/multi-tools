# Information
I will update this project almost every day, so watch out for updates and give the project a star to support me :)

I'm mostly tired while I code this, so if something doesn't work just open an issue thing and don't be mad.

# Open Source
yes this project is open source, but please don't resell it or remake it/copy it and upload it without giving credits to me and all people I credited in the credits title.

this project is open source so you can see how easy it is to hack/crack something or someone or do some bullshit with acess tokens etc. but don't use it for malicious purposes.

# BuT sNeE, iF yOu CaN cOdE, wHy DoN't u MaKe It YoUrSeLf
Because I don't want to waste time since this project is free anyways

# Why isn't it only one file?
1. So we can edit it easier (don't have to scroll through all the bullshit

2. So skids also have some work to do if they want to change everything

3. So you can't just (instantly) obfusocate and resell it :]
